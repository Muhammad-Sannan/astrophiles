    <p>Black holes are areas of space with such strong a gravitational pull that even light cannot escape. When a massive star dies and its core collapses inward, a tiny point in the middle of the black hole called The <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity">Singularity</a> is formed. Anything that crosses the <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon">Event Horizon</a> gets pulled into the singularity since there is no going back from it. Despite the fact that black holes are invisible to the human eye, by observing the effects they have on the objects nearby, scientists can learn more about them. In many ways, a black hole behaves like a perfect black body because it doesn't reflect light.</p>

    <h2>HOW ARE THEY FORMED?</h2>
    <p>According to scientific theories, the tiniest black holes formed during the early stages of the universe's evolution.</p>  <p>Stellar black holes, on the other hand, are produced by the inward collapse of the central region of a massive star, which leads to a <a target="_blank" class="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova">Supernova</a> explosion that ejects some of the star's material into space.</p><p>As for supermassive black holes, scientists believe that they were formed concurrently with the galaxy they reside in, as these black holes have a strong connection with the galaxy's evolution. However, the precise process by which these enormous black holes form is still not fully understood and is the subject of ongoing research.</p>

    <h2>SIZE OF A BLACK HOLE</h2>
    <p>Black holes come in many sizes, from the smallest to the greatest. According to specialists, the smallest black holes are as little as a single atom but have the mass of a gigantic mountain. The mass of an object is the amount of matter it contains.</p><p>   A <b>Stellar</b> black hole is another form of black hole that can weigh up to <b>20 times</b> the mass of the sun. It is possible that many black holes with masses comparable to stars exist within the Milky Way galaxy, which is where the Earth is located.</p><p>The largest type are <b>Supermassive</b> black holes. Each of these enormous black holes is more than a million suns in mass. There is evidence, according to astronomers, that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its nucleus. The <a target="_blank" class="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*">Sagittarius A</a>, for instance With a mass of around 4 million suns, a supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way galaxy may perhaps fit inside a large sphere a few million times the size of Earth.</p>

    <h2>HOW ARE THEY SEEN?</h2>
    <p>Due to their tremendous gravitational pull on all nearby light and stuff, black holes are invisible. However, scientists can deduce their presence indirectly by looking at how their gravitational attraction affects nearby stars and gases. By observing the movements and orbits of stars in a specific region, scientists can infer the existence of a black hole.</p><p>A star may also release high-energy radiation that is invisible to the human eye due to the intense gravitational attraction of a black hole. To discover this radiation, scientists employ cutting-edge tools like satellites in orbit and telescopes. Scientists believe that by examining these emissions, it will be possible to better comprehend the features and behaviour of black holes.</p>

    <h2>SOUND FROM A BLACK HOLE</h2>
    <p>Black holes are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing can escape from them, not even light and as a result, they themselves do not create sound waves. Therefore, there is nothing that can vibrate or produce sound within the black hole. By modifying the neighbouring matter, black holes, however, may emit sound waves in their environs. As matter enters a black hole, it is accelerated to extremely high speeds and heated to extremely high temperatures, which causes it to emit radiation in many forms, including X-rays and gamma rays. This radiation may be detectable by sensors and telescopes on Earth by vibrating the surrounding atmosphere and creating sound waves. These sound waves have an exceedingly low frequency, making them detectable only to sophisticated instruments like the <a target="_blank" class="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO">Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)</a>. When massive objects, like black holes, accelerate and collide, gravitational waves are created. These disruptions in the very structure of spacetime are caused by this process. LIGO and other comparable instruments may find powerful gravity waves from these mergers. Here is a NASA audio recording of a supermassive black hole.</p>
